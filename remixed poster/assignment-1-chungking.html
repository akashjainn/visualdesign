                <h2>The Assignment: Abstract</h2>
                <div class="assignment-content">
                    <h3>Intent</h3>
                    <p>Apply Photoshop skills to produce a derivative piece of work uniquely my own. By understanding design elements including abstraction through simplification, weight, balance, and composition rules, I break down the original artist's work into its core elements—reimagining it through my own aesthetic. This is remix culture in practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>Remix a selected movie poster by pulling out core design elements and creating new compositions. The remix is reimagined to change the intent of the original poster to a message I want to convey, applying a completely new aesthetic that shifts both the look/style and the message.</p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Canvas: 11" × 17" (Tabloid) at 300ppi, RGB Color Mode</li>
                        <li>Submit JPG of original poster (002_Final_Orig.jpg)</li>
                        <li>Submit JPG of final remixed poster (002_Final_Remix.jpg)</li>

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I began by analyzing Chungking Express—the original film's visual language, color palette, typography, and compositional structure. I identified core design elements: the delicate interplay of light and color, the urban geometry, the sense of longing and motion. I then systematically deconstructed these elements, simplifying them to their most essential forms, and recombined them under a completely different aesthetic framework. The result shifts from the original's romantic urban exploration to a new visual and narrative direction that emphasizes my own design sensibilities.</p>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>1. Aesthetic Transformation (1 pt)</h3>
                    <p>The remixed poster employs a distinctly different visual language. The original's soft, romantic color palette and delicate typography give way to a bolder, more geometric aesthetic. I shifted from pastel tones and flowing forms to a more structured, high-contrast approach, incorporating sharper lines and reimagined color relationships that create visual tension rather than softness. This transformation is achieved through strategic color shifts, typography changes, and form reconstruction.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>2. Message & Intent Shift (1 pt)</h3>
                    <p>The original Chungking Express poster conveys urban romance, melancholy, and intimate human connection in a bustling city. My remix reframes this to explore themes of [your new theme/message], shifting from the original's introspective, romantic tone to a [new emotional/conceptual direction]. This transformation is achieved through element repositioning, color psychology, and compositional hierarchy that emphasizes different narrative aspects.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>3. Understanding of Design Principles (2 pts)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Composition:</strong> Original uses soft, centered focal points; my approach employs asymmetrical balance and dynamic diagonal lines. <strong>Weight & Balance:</strong> Shifted from distributed visual weight to concentrated emphasis through color and form. <strong>Abstraction & Simplification:</strong> Extracted core geometric shapes from the original's forms and recombined them. <strong>Form Language:</strong> Transitioned from organic, flowing forms to geometric, linear constructions. These shifts demonstrate integrated understanding of class concepts.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>4. Design Context & Justification (1 pt)</h3>
                    <p>Every compositional choice serves the new narrative intent. Color palette was selected based on [color theory rationale]. Typography choice reflects [stylistic decision]. Element placement guides viewers through [visual hierarchy]. The overall composition creates a visual flow that supports and reinforces the reimagined message, making the design changes purposeful rather than arbitrary.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>5. Form & Abstraction (Part of criteria)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Core Elements Extracted:</strong> Delicate facial forms, urban geometric planes, light effects, typography forms, color relationships. I simplified these through geometric abstraction, removing decorative elements while retaining structural essence. <strong>Recomposition:</strong> These abstracted elements were recombined into a new configuration that inverts the original's focal hierarchy and introduces fresh compositional dynamics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>6. Visual Hierarchy & Narrative Flow (Part of criteria)</h3>
                    <p>Typography, color, and spatial arrangement guide the viewer's eye through a new narrative sequence. In the original, the focus is soft and distributed; in my remix, the eye is drawn to [primary focal point], then guides through [secondary elements]. This creates a narrative flow that supports the new message and aesthetic direction, making the viewing experience distinctly different.</p>
