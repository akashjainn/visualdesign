                <div class="assignment-content">
                    <h3>Intent</h3>
                    <p>Apply Photoshop skills to produce a derivative piece of work uniquely my own. By understanding design elements including abstraction through simplification, weight, balance, and composition rules, I break down the original artist's work into its core elements—reimagining it through my own aesthetic. This is remix culture in practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>Remix a selected movie poster by pulling out core design elements and creating new compositions. The remix is reimagined to change the intent of the original poster to a message I want to convey, applying a completely new aesthetic that shifts both the look/style and the message.</p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>

                <h2>Project Context</h2>
                <p>For this assignment, I remixed the original Chungking Express movie poster by intentionally "destroying" its original meaning and aesthetic and rebuilding it through a different genre lens. The goal was not to enhance or modernize the original design, but to subvert it—extracting its core compositional elements and reapplying them to communicate an entirely new message.</p>
                
                <p>I began by analyzing the original poster's structure: a dense collage of fragmented images, overlapping textures, and energetic movement that reflects the film's themes of chance encounters, romance, and emotional spontaneity. Rather than removing this fragmentation, I preserved it and reframed it as a source of tension and unease. By shifting the color palette toward darker values, increasing contrast, and suppressing saturation, the collage transitions from playful chaos into psychological pressure.</p>
                
                <p>To further alter the narrative, I introduced blood as a recurring visual motif. Instead of using blood purely as a graphic effect, I treated it as a compositional and conceptual element. The blood creates directional flow across the poster, adds visual weight, and binds separate fragments together, transforming the sense of coincidence into inevitability and violence. This shift recontextualizes the story from one of fleeting connection to one of obsession, corruption, and threat.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout the process, I used masking, adjustment layers, and layered textures to maintain non-destructive control while experimenting with abstraction, balance, and hierarchy. The typography was intentionally distressed and partially obscured to reflect the idea that the original narrative is being overwritten by a darker interpretation.</p>
                
                <p>This remix demonstrates how the same underlying structure can support radically different meanings depending on aesthetic choices. By altering tone, color, texture, and symbolic elements, I transformed a romantic neo-noir poster into a psychological horror/thriller, highlighting how design decisions shape narrative perception.</p>

                    <h3>1. Aesthetic Transformation (1 pt)</h3>
                    <p>The remixed poster employs a distinctly different visual language. The original's soft, romantic color palette and delicate typography give way to a bolder, more geometric aesthetic. I shifted from pastel tones and flowing forms to a more structured, high-contrast approach, incorporating sharper lines and reimagined color relationships that create visual tension rather than softness. This transformation is achieved through strategic color shifts, typography changes, and form reconstruction.</p>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>2. Message & Intent Shift (1 pt)</h3>
                    <p>The original Chungking Express poster conveys urban romance, melancholy, and intimate human connection in a bustling city. My remix reframes this to explore themes of psychological horror, violence, and obsession, shifting from the original's introspective, romantic tone to a darker, more threatening emotional direction. This transformation is achieved through element repositioning, color psychology (darker values, suppressed saturation), and compositional hierarchy that emphasizes tension, inevitability, and threat rather than chance and connection.</p>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>3. Understanding of Design Principles (2 pts)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Composition:</strong> Original uses soft, centered focal points; my approach employs asymmetrical balance and dynamic diagonal lines. <strong>Weight & Balance:</strong> Shifted from distributed visual weight to concentrated emphasis through color and form. <strong>Abstraction & Simplification:</strong> Extracted core geometric shapes from the original's forms and recombined them. <strong>Form Language:</strong> Transitioned from organic, flowing forms to geometric, linear constructions. These shifts demonstrate integrated understanding of class concepts.</p>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>4. Design Context & Justification (1 pt)</h3>
                    <p>Every compositional choice serves the new narrative intent. Color palette was selected based on psychological impact—darker values and suppressed saturation create unease and psychological pressure. Typography choice reflects the distressed, corrupted nature of the reframed narrative through intentional distress and partial obscuring. Element placement guides viewers through a visual hierarchy that emphasizes blood as a unifying compositional motif, creating directional flow and visual weight. The overall composition creates a visual flow that supports and reinforces the transformation from romantic coincidence to violent inevitability.</p>

                    <h3>5. Form & Abstraction (Part of criteria)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Core Elements Extracted:</strong> Delicate facial forms, urban geometric planes, light effects, typography forms, color relationships. I simplified these through geometric abstraction, removing decorative elements while retaining structural essence. <strong>Recomposition:</strong> These abstracted elements were recombined into a new configuration that inverts the original's focal hierarchy and introduces fresh compositional dynamics.</p>

                <div class="justification-item">
                    <h3>6. Visual Hierarchy & Narrative Flow (Part of criteria)</h3>
                    <p>Typography, color, and spatial arrangement guide the viewer's eye through a new narrative sequence. In the original, the focus is soft and distributed; in my remix, the eye is drawn to [primary focal point], then guides through [secondary elements]. This creates a narrative flow that supports the new message and aesthetic direction, making the viewing experience distinctly different.</p>
