## 📸 Next Steps: Add Your Images

The website is ready, but you need to add your assignment images to complete it. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images

You need to copy these images from your Chungking Express project folder and rename them:

**From:** `C:\Users\akash\Documents\school\junior\visual design\chungking`

**Copy these files to:** `c:\Users\akash\Documents\visual design\remixed poster\images\`

| Original File | Rename To | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| original chungking express poster | `original-chungking-express-poster.jpg` | Original poster |
| remixed chungking express poster | `remixed-chungking-express-poster.jpg` | Final remix |
| ckp1 | `ckp1.jpg` | Process Step 1 |
| ckp2 | `ckp2.jpg` | Process Step 2 |
| ckp3 | `ckp3.jpg` | Process Step 3 |
| ckp4 | `ckp4.jpg` | Process Step 4 |
| ckp5 | `ckp5.jpg` | Process Step 5 |

### Step 2: Optimize Images for Web

Before adding to the website:
- **Resolution:** Convert to 72-150ppi (web resolution)
- **File Size:** Keep under 2MB per image
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Tool Options:**
  - Adobe Photoshop: Image → Image Size → Set to 72ppi
  - Online: TinyJPG.com, Optimizilla.com, or Compressor.io
  - Windows: Right-click → Resize images

### Step 3: File Organization

Your folder structure should look like:
```
remixed poster/
├── images/
│   ├── original-chungking-express-poster.jpg
│   ├── remixed-chungking-express-poster.jpg
│   ├── ckp1.jpg
│   ├── ckp2.jpg
│   ├── ckp3.jpg
│   ├── ckp4.jpg
│   └── ckp5.jpg
├── index.html
